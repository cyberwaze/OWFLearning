<h3>Types of Cyberattacks</h3>

<input type="checkbox" id="s1" />
<label for="s1">Social Engineering</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Social Engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.</p>
	<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>Phising: An opened message from an appeared legitamate source that asks the user for personal information, tricking users. Various forms of phishing are listed below.</li>
					<aside>
						<nav>
							<ul>
								<li>Spearphishing: Attacks specifically targetted individuals with common interests, highly personalized.</li>
								<li>Whaling: Under the spearphishing category, messages are targeted to high-profile individuals in an organization.</li>
								<li>Voice Phishing: Sending messages through voice appearing as urgent from governmental agencies.</li>
								<li>SMS Phishing: The vector of phishing is through text messages.</li>
								<li>Watering Hole Attack: Attackers first watch their victims to gain knowledge on the websites they often travel to, then the attacker inserts malware into those sites.</li>

<label for="s2">Malicious Software</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Malicious Software, or Malware, specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to the operations of computers and communication systems. The various types of malware are defined below.
  </p>
	<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>Virus: Activated by opening an e-mail file attachment and can do almost anything on a computer system or mobile device. </li>
					<li>Worms: Can replicate and forward themselves to other systems by forwarding to addresses in the system, spreading the thread.</li>
					<li>Trojans: Downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. Malware remains on the system even after the main infected program is deleted. </li>
					<li>Ransomware: A form of malware that locks the user out of a system or file until the user pays ransom. Usually distributed as a virus or worm.</li>
				</ul>

<input type="checkbox" id="s3" />
<label for="s3">Denial-of-Service</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Denial-of-Service attacks aim to use the resource exhaustion strategy, where the attacker consumes all of the available bandwidth in a communications channel or all of the processing power in an internet based server. This will shut down the network or system to users.</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="s4" />
<label for="s4">Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>An Advanced Persistent Threat is when a nation state or state-sponsored group gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period. The goal is long-term access rather than short-term disruption. </p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="s5" />
<label for="s5">Zero-Day Exploits</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Following a cyberattack, the vulnerabilities that allowed this attack to occur are discovered to update and protect the system. The shear amount of vulnerabilities makes it impossible to fix all of them quickly, and will take time to fully analyze the system.</p>
	 <p>Zero-day-exploit means an attack that was to exploit a vulnerability that was unknown or unpatched before the attack on that vulnerability happened.  </p>
