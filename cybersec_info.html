<div class="panel">
	<p>Social Engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Phishing: A message from an apparently legitamate source that tricks the recipient into revealing personal information. Various forms 
						of phishing are listed below.</li>
					<aside>
						<nav>
							<ul>
								<li>Spear Phishing: Highly personalized attacks specifically targeting individuals with common interests.</li>
								<li>Whaling: Under the spearphishing category, these messages target high-profile individuals in an organization.</li>
								<li>Voice Phishing (Vishing): The vector of phishing is through the use of telephony.</li>
								<li>SMS Phishing: The vector of phishing is through text messages.</li>
								<li>Watering Hole Attack: Attackers first watch their victims to see which websites they often visit; then attackers 
									insert malware into those sites to infect site visitors.</li>

<label for="s2">Malicious Software</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Malicious Software, or Malware, refers to code that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to the operations of computers and 
		communication systems. The various types of malware are defined below.
  </p>
	<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>Virus: Activated by opening an e-mail file attachment and can do almost anything on a computer system or mobile device. </li>
					<li>Worms: Malware that can replicate and forward itself to other systems by using contact addresses discovered in an infected system, thereby spreading 
						the infection.</li>
					<li>Trojans: Downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. Malware remains on the system even after the main infected program is deleted. </li>
					<li>Ransomware: A form of malware that locks users out of a system or file until they pay ransom to the attacker. Often distributed as a virus or worm.</li>

<input type="checkbox" id="s3" />
<label for="s3">Denial-of-Service</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Denial-of-Service attacks use a resource exhaustion strategy. That is, the attacker consumes all available bandwidth in a communications channel or all processing power 
		in an internet-based server. This effectively shuts down the network or system to other users.</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="s4" />
<label for="s4">Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) refers to a hacking technique in which the goal is to gain unauthorized access to a computer network and to remain undetected, slowly 
		stealing information over an extended period of time. Due to the sophistication and resources required, APTs are usually attributable to state-sponsored hacker groups 
		and are aimed at high-value targets like nation states or corporations.</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="s5" />
<label for="s5">Zero-Day Exploits</label>
<div class="panel">
	 <p>A zero-day-exploit refers to a cyber attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability that was unknown or unpatched at the time the attack occurs.</p>
