	<div class="panel">
		<p>The U.S. Maritime Transportation System (MTS) consists:</p>

		<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>25,000 miles of navigable channels</li>
					<li>95,000 miles of shoreline</li>
					<li>361 commercial ports</li>
					<li>50,000 federal and private aids to navigation (ATONs)</li>
					<li>20,000 bridges that span over water</li>
					<li>Over 3,700 marine terminals</li>
					<li>200 ferry operations</li>
					<li>238 locks at 192 locations</li>
				</ul>
			</nav>

		<p>The user community, another part of the MTS, includes hundreds of thousands of small charter fishing, sightseeing, liveaboard, and dive boats, as well as more than 12 million recreational boats</p>

	<label for="s2">Six Interconnected Systems</label>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The MTS is comprised of six interconnected systems. They include: ships, shipping lines, people, ports, intermodal transfers, and inland waterways.</p>

		<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>Ships: Includes aspects in the lifecycle of a vessel (manufacturing, maintenance, operations, disposal, communications, networks, and navigation systems.</li>
					<li>Shipping Lines: Comprises of the operation and management of the companies that own ships. This subsystem also includes the handling of passengers and cargo, reservation and scheduling systems, finances, operations, and communications.</li>
					<li>People: Includes the entire supply chain, trading, vendors, and customers.</li>
					<li>Ports: Includes the construction and maintenance of ports, logistics within ports, vessel traffic management, and all aspects of daily port operations.</li>
					<li>Intermodal Transfers: Describes how the maritime sector interfaces with other transportation modalities, including the inland barge system, railroads, trucking, and aviation.</li>
					<li>Inland Waterways: Includes the inland waterway system, associated ATONs, and dredging and maintenance of the waterways.</li>

	<label for="s3">Cyberattack Vectors Through and Within the Maritime Environment</label>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>Some cyberattack vectors that exist through and within the maritime environment include:</p>

		<aside>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>Vessel Operations</li>
					<li>Shipping Line Operations</li>
					<li>Port Operations</li>
					<li>Cargo and Shipping</li>
					<li>Manufacturing</li>
					<li>Vessel Traffic Control (VTC)</li>
					<li>Remote Control/Autonomy</li>
				</ul>

		<p>Cybersecurity is critical in preventing potential cyberattacks because hackers could utilize one vulnerable system in order to exploit another. Furthermore, this also emphasizes the interconnectedness of each system within the maritime environment.</p>

	<label for="s4">Examples of Cyberattacks on Maritime Operations</label>
	<div class="panel">
		<h3>AIS Spoofing (2021)</h3>
		<p> The tracking data of two NATO warships were faked off the coast of a Russian-controlled naval base in the Black Sea while the actual ships were moored 180 miles away, USNI News has learned. The automatic identification system placed the two ships off the coast of Russia, but live webcams showed that the two ships had never left Odessa. Although the motives were unclear, the deception caused disruption, and AIS systems efficacy has been questioned.</p>

		<h3>Shen Attack (2019)</h3>
		<p>There is a malicious computer virus that mixes up the cargo database records at some major ports in Asia. Since there is no information on contents on cargo ships, the infected ports close for up for a while and halt maritime operations as each container is examined manually. This severely disrupts maritime operations. A lot of economic losses are created by the impact of perishable goods and late delivery of goods, along with the intense business interruption resulting from the closures. In the most extreme variant, 15 ports can be infected leading to total economic losses of nearly $110 billion. </p>

		<h3>Collisions of Ships and Wind Turbines</h3>
		<p>There have been multiple hypothetical scenarios created where cargo ships can run into offshore wind farms. One example was created in 2004 where three ships were damaged and approximately 54,400 tons of oil were spilled into the ocean. To prevent this, multiple navigation systems have been put into place. This is important because if the navigation is hacked, ships could be weaponized to attack the wind turbines. </p>
