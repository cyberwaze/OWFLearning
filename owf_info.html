		<p>Offshore wind farms (OWF) consist of multiple turbines all connected and communicating with each other. The protocols used to run the turbines
			within the farm itself travel over wired connections that typically have little to no authentication, encryption or other security 
			features. In other words, they pass around instructions that can be easily intercepted, manipulated or spoofed. There also are wireless 
			communications from the base of the towers to the power-generating components on top.</p>

		<p>Underwater and underground cables carry the generated electric power back to shore, passing through an offshore substation, an onshore substation, 
			and ultimately feeding into the grid. Operators at control centers monitor and control the production and flow of power by sending commands 
			to the farm. The farm communicates sensor data back to the center to help operators fine tune performance.  This creates a two-way 
			wireless communication path between the farm and the control center.</p>

		<p>To help regulate  power flow, grid operators communicate with the farm's control center via  dedicated communication lines or the public Internet. 
			Enterprise systems may connect to these centers via public Internet connections for receiving data and providing services. All these 
			communication paths can be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks.</p>
	
		<p>There are confirmed hacks on onshore wind farms attributed to nation-state actors as far back as 2014 and as recently as May 2019. 
			Offshore wind farms rely on the same information and operational technology as onshore wind farms, which means we can expect 
			them to be vulnerable to similar attacks.</p>

	<h3>Known Exploits on Onshore Wind Farms</h3>

	<p>There have been NO confirmed attacks on offshore wind farms to date. In the absense of contrary evidence, however, it must be assumed that offshore wind farms remain 
		vulnerable to attacks similar to those that have been successful against onshore wind farms.</p>
