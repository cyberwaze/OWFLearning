		<h2>Vulnerabilities</h2>
		<p></p>There is no zero cyber risk environment today, since new cyber threats and vulnerabilities are constantly emerging. 
		Despite mitigations, vulnerabilities remain in people, processes and technologies, and attackers are constantly 
		trying to find new ways to break through cyber defenses. Known vulnerabilities likely to be present in the ecosystem 
		involving OWF, maritime and critical infrastructure are summarized below.</p>

<label for="e0">Humans</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>  Verizon's 2021 DBIR observes that social engineering and phishing attacks are widely used to steal credentials and spread 
  malware. The majority of these incidents are discovered externally, meaning when targetted individuals fall for such ploys, they 
  may not even realize they have been compromised.</p>
  <p>Thus humans with physical or electronic access to any elements of an IT/OT ecosystem such as we find in OWFs remain among the 
  most hackable elements. They can be cooerced or tricked into revealing credentials or injecting malware with immediate or 
  longer-term side-effects.</p>

<label for="e1">Onshore control center</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The control facilities for  OWF monitoring and operations are distant and centralized, enabling 
  overarching setpoints and curtainments including shutdown. This means an attack on a single facility could move 
  laterally to affect multiple geographically dispersed OWFs all controlled from that one facility, 
  significantly disrupting power production.</p>
  <p>Control center operators use market, weather and grid data to monitor and control OWFs. Spoofing this data 
  could significantly destabilize and damage the plant. Due to the size of modern rotors and towers, if this 
  progresses to a catastrophic physical failure, massive deadly spinning debris can be flung over thousands of 
  square kilometers.</p>

<label for="e2">Onshore substation</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Onshore substations transfer the electricity generated from the wind farms and offshore substations to the grid. The vulnerabilities of the onshore substations 
	  are very similar to the vulnerabilities of the offshore substations. Besides just physical attacks, a cyber attack could be used to halt the transfer of the electricity 
	  to the grid, producing a brownout or blackout.
</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="e3" />
<label for="e3">Offshore substation</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Offshore substations are responsible for connecting to the wind farm by undersea cables and changing the voltage so that the electric power can transfer to the onshore 
	  substation. There can be physical attacks on this substation, but a cyber attack could block the substation from transfering the electric power and making the offshore 
	  wind farms useless.</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="e4" />
<label for="e4">Undersea Cables</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Undersea cables are typically used to transport energy generated from wind turbines to onshore facilities like power stations or control centers. While undersea cables are 
	  generally not susceptible to cybersecurity attacks, they remain targets in physical attacks, potentially disrupting onshore operations and power transmissions to 
	  communities.</p>
  <p>Physical attacks to undersea cables can come in the form of breakage. This can be accomplished through the use of explosives or locating where the cables reach the surface 
	  of the water to damage them. The landing stations, which are onshore facilities where undersea cables come onshore, are known to be lightly protected, thus providing 
	  another opportunity for physical attack. Undersea cables also can be attacked via “wire-tapping” which allows hackers to obtain data being transferred from the cable 
	  without physical penetration, or to inject alternative "spoofed" data for ulterior purposes.</p>

<input type="checkbox" id="e5" />
<label for="e5">Maritime vessels</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Aboard maritime vessels, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to monitor and control the ship's equipment. If the SCADA system is compromised, 
	  the vessel could be directed to collide with a wind turbine, physically destroying the structure. Debris in the waterway would disrupt navigation and create a clean-up 
	  job for organizations like the USCG. 
</p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="e6" />
<label for="e6">Wind Turbines</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Each wind farm installation may have some unique characteristics; however the remote nature of the plants will generally use a fiber-optic Transmission Control 
	  Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network to communicate between the controllers to each plant. Most of the communication controls are designed to be fast 
	  speed with lightweight data exchanges and do not require authentication, encryption, and other security features, which therefore can be easily infiltrated 
	  through spoofing or cyber manipulation.</p>
  <p>The turbines will also utilize CCTV Systems for physical security and maintenance monitoring.  The remote nature of these turbines will most likely lead to the use of 
	  IP based systems that will communicate with the Onshore Control Center. The cameras could be attacked by stopping or looping the feed which could allow a threat actor 
	  to physically breach the turbine without being noticed, causing damage or injecting malware.</p>
