		<h2>Open Questions</h2>
		<h3>Here is a list of open questions that through research we could not confirm regarding the implementation of OWFs.</h3>

</head>

<body>

<div>
	<p>1.) Are the same communication protocols being used in offshore wind farms as onshore wind farms?</p>

	<p>2.) Are the control systems on the onshore wind farms the same as offshore wind farms?</p>

	<p>3.) Is there an assurance plan if a cybersecurity threat does occur?</p>
	
	<p>4.) What policies and regulations need to be set to protect the onshore and offshore wind farms from cybersecurity threats?</p>
	
	<p>5.) Have there been any verified hacks of offshore wind farms?</p>
	
	<p>6.) Specific turbines being used in US offshore wind farms include GE’s Haliade-X and  Siemens Gamesa SG. Have cybersecurity vulnerabilities potentially present in these turbines and associated control firmware/hardware been scrutinized?</p>
	
	<p>7.) Do OWFs emit or receive any kind of navigational information such as AIS?</p>
	
	<p>8.) Has a reference architecture for US OWFs been established?</p>
	
	<p>9.) Are test beds or “digital twins” being established to perform ongoing cybersecurity penetration testing of OWFs?</p>
