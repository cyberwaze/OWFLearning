<h3>Wireless Communication</h3>

<label for="s1">Narrative</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>The vulnerability demonstrated by this graphic pertains to wireless communication between wind turbines. By taking advantage of wireless communication between wind turbines, hackers can successfully hack into wind turbines and inject malware. Offshore wind turbines are vulnerable to such physical attacks because they are out in the middle of the ocean and not in constant surveillance, thus a person can get to the base of a turbine and cause a more direct attack by plugging in a broadcasting device. In the situation depicted by the graphic, a ship carrying malware sails by wind turbines that are communicating with one another, and broadcasts malware to the turbines. Shipboard systems have been confirmed to be vulnerable to malware injections, as this has occurred in the past, therefore making this scenario more plausible. Once the hacker broadcasts and transmits the malware from the ship the turbine, malware can directly damage the turbines or make its way to inland systems, including the electric grid, where the impacts will be more widespread.</p>

<h3>CCTV Systems</h3>

<input type="checkbox" id="s2" />
<label for="s2">Narrative</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The use of CCTV Cameras on Offshore Wind Turbines and Offshore substations has been confirmed for the purpose of physical security and maintenance monitoring. Due to the remote nature and extreme conditions of offshore windfarms, the camera most likely to be used is an IP CCTV System that will communicate with the onshore control center.</p>

	<p>If a hacker were to log onto the IP address and guess the password, they would easily be able to access the camera network and use it to complete a physical security breach without being seen. Hackers could import a looped video so the control center is unaware of a physical breach to the critical infrastructure, which could be used for destruction or to inject malware directly. </p>

<h3>Communication Pathways</h3>

<input type="checkbox" id="s3" />
<label for="s3">Narrative</label>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Hackers can use these communication pathways to interrupt, modify, or replace commands with false or “spoofed” information. Once hackers penetrate one part of the cyber-physical system, the attack can follow those paths to move from turbine to turbine and even travel to other wind farms that might be communicating with the same control center to make an bigger attack.</p>

	<p>A nation-state-sponsored hacking group or opportunistic hacktivists likely will target the control center by remotely hacking into it through the externally accessible communications pathways; or by tricking or bribing an “insider” employee with the right credentials to gain access. They’ll escalate their privileges on the resident systems and use the center’s ability to issue commands to the farm to insert malicious commands aimed at the local area network connecting and controlling the farm’s turbines.</p>
