	<div class="panel">
		<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a federal agency that was created to protect the critical infrastructure of the United States. Under the oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CISA aims to defends against cyber attacks while working with the federal government to provide cybersecurity tools, incident response tools, and assessment capabilities to protect .gov networks. </p>

		<p>There are two chief centers within CISA: the National Cybersecurity and Communications Intergration Center (NCCIC) as well as the National Rish Management Center (NRMC). The NCCIC is responsible for providing cyber-situational awareness, analysis, incident response, and cyber-defense capabilities to its partners. These partners can include the federal government; state, local, tribal and territorial governments; the private sector; and international partners. The NMIC is center more geared towards to planning, analysis and collaboration in working to identify and address the potential and significant risks posed to the USA's critical infrastructure.</p>

	<label for="s3">Examples of Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure</label>
	<div class="panel">
		<h3>Bowman Avenue Dam Attack (2013)</h3>
		<p> In 2013, Iranian hackers gained control of the floodgates of the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York. Although they successfully gained control of the dam, their attack was a failure because the dam was offline for maintainence reasons. However, if successful, this attack could have resulted in flooding.</p>

		<h3>Equifax Data Breach (2017)</h3>
		<p>In 2017, hackers were able to gain access to personal information, like Social Security numbers and birth dates, through compromising Equifax Co.'s systems. Hackers exploited Equifax through an unpatched vulnerability that allowed hackers to gain access to personal information. As a result, almost 144 million Americans were affected by the attack.  </p>

		<h3>Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)</h3>
    	<p> On May 7th, 2021, Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware cyber attack that compromised the computer equipment that managed the pipeline's operation. Hackers, who were believed to have been part of the Russian company DarkSide, were able to gain access to the pipeline's networks by creating a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. Not only did the attack delay deliveries in gas, but also impacted the trucking industry, gas prices, and airline operations.</p>
