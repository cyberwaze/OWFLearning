	<div class="panel">
		<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a federal agency that was created to protect the critical infrastructure 
			of the United States. Under the oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CISA aims to defends against cyber attacks while 
			working with the federal government to provide cybersecurity tools, incident response tools, and assessment capabilities to protect 
			.gov networks. </p>

		<p>There are two chief centers within CISA: the National Cybersecurity and Communications Intergration Center (NCCIC); and the National Risk 
			Management Center (NRMC). The NCCIC is responsible for providing cyber-situational awareness, analysis, incident response, 
			and cyber-defense capabilities to its partners. These partners can include the federal government; state, local, tribal and territorial 
			governments; the private sector; and international partners. The NRMC is more geared towards planning, analysis and collaboration 
			in working to identify and address the potential and significant risks posed to the USA's critical infrastructure.</p>

	<div class="panel">
		<h3>Bowman Avenue Dam Attack (2013)</h3>
		<p> In 2013, Iranian hackers gained control of the floodgates of the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York.  Their attack was a failure,
			however, because the dam was offline for maintainence reasons. If successful, this attack could have resulted in extensive, deadly flooding.</p>

		<h3>Equifax Data Breach (2017)</h3>
		<p>In 2017, hackers were able to gain access to personal information, like Social Security numbers and birth dates, through compromising 
			Equifax's systems. Hackers exploited Equifax through an unpatched vulnerability that allowed them to gain access to personal information. 
			Almost 144 million Americans were affected by the attack.  </p>

		<h3>Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)</h3>
    		<p> On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware cyber attack that compromised the computer equipment used to manage the pipeline's 
			operation. Hackers, who were believed to be part of the Russian group DarkSide, were able to gain access to the pipeline's networks 
			by creating a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. Not only did the attack delay deliveries in gas, but also impacted the trucking 
			industry, gas prices, and airline operations.</p>
